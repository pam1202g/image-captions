    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As Generating Image Captions addresses a problem similar to Neural Translation, that is translating image to text captions, hence the model uses an Encoder Decoder Architecture for generating Captions from input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Encoder CNN layer uses a pretrained Resnet50 model to extract image features and these features are passed through a linear layer to fit these features to an embedding size. I have used the provided architecture for the Encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decoder RNN embeds the captions and passes it through the LSTM. Next, the LSTM output is passed through a linear layer to get the word predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used following values for the Hyperparameters of the Decoder RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "- `batch_size` - I have used 100 as the batch size, which is neither too large nor too small. As too large size requires greater computing cost(increased memory), too low batch size might lead to gradient noise.\n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) suggested 5 as the vocab threshold, so I set it to 5   \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - I set it to False to generate the vocabulary. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - I have used 512 as the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings as suggested in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - I have used 512 as the dimensionality of the LSTM memory as suggested in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - I have set it to 3. I got pretty resonable result after running it for 3 epochs and got good predictions. I would further experiment with more number of epochs and a stacked LSTM in my own laptop, once I get\n",
    "everything installed.\n",
    "- `learning_rate` - I have used a learning rate of le-3 for the optimizer\n",
    "- `save_every` - 1\n",
    "- `print_every` - 100\n",
    "- `log_file` - training_log.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I have used the provided values for the transforms because it seemed quite well-thought to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  RandomCrop and RandomFlip are used in Data Augmentation Techniques which helps the model to generalize better\n",
    "-  As the Resize() changes the image size to 256x256, which is quite large, the RandomCrop() gets enough room to randomly crop the input image to 224x224, which is a widely used input size for the Resnet50 Encoder. So the Randomly cropped image fits well as the CNN input.\n",
    "-  The normalization of images facilitates the training of neural network. Scaling our input training vectors before passing it to the CNN, helps the ranges of our distributions of feature values to be similar in scale, which helps network training and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I wanted to make all weights in the decoder trainable and only the weights in the embedding layer \n",
    "of the encoder trainable. Since I am using a Pretrained Resnet50 model, I wanted to take advantage of its already \n",
    "learned weights. Only the embedding layer in the encoder needed training. Since we are using a new Decoder RNN which was never trained before, I wanted to train all the weights of the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is a good choice because I am using transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained CNN architecture to extract the features and only training the embedding layer in the encoder, hence saving time while getting good result. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I used Adam Optimizer because it can adapt to different learning rates, based on a moving estimate of the per-parameter gradient, and the per-parameter squared gradient. It has been widely used in several deep learning projects. I got pretty reasonable results using Adam."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
